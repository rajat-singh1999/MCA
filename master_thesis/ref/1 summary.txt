Distinctive Features of Diamonds: Authors in the past have noticed that diamonds from various sources exhibit unique characteristics related to physical properties. These properties include size, color, morphology (shape), crystal perfection, and hardness.

Quantitative Investigations Needed: To fully differentiate diamond sources, quantitative investigations are necessary. While distinctive features have been observed qualitatively, quantitative studies are required for a more precise understanding.

Previous Studies: Previous researchers have conducted studies on diamonds from different sources, such as Russian diamond sources, Sierra Leone, and Lesotho. These studies explored relationships between diamond morphology, surface features, and size.

Qualitative Evaluation: Qualitative evaluations of physical features of diamonds from various regions have also been completed by researchers.

Detailed Study Initiated: In 1970, a detailed study of the physical characteristics of diamonds was initiated by two authors. The goal was to quantitatively separate diamonds from different sources based on physical parameters.

Diamond Characteristics Vary with Size: Pilot studies showed that diamond characteristics vary with the size of the diamond. Therefore, physical parameters were determined with respect to diamond size, and surface features were not considered as part of the classification scheme.

Specific Mines Studied: The study focused on diamonds from three kimberlite mines (Premier, Koffyfontein, and Finsch) and one alluvial mine (Dreyers Pan in Namaqualand).

Number of Diamonds Examined: A significant number of diamonds were examined from each of these four mines, with each number rounded to the nearest hundred.

Unique Definition: The results of the study indicate that diamonds from these four mines can now be uniquely defined based on their physical parameters. This suggests that these parameters can serve as identifiers of the diamond's source.

Relationships with Size: The study also found that for diatreme sources (kimberlite mines), diamonds exhibit distinct relationships concerning crystal form and color in relation to diamond size.

Environmental Considerations: The passage ends by mentioning an attempt to evaluate these trends in terms of the initial environment of the diamond and its possible subsequent environmental history.

Overall, the paper highlights the importance of quantitative studies in differentiating diamonds from various sources based on their physical characteristics, with a particular focus on size, crystal form, and color.

FINAL REMARKS:

The results of the diamond classification study indicate that based on their physical characteristics, diamond samples from four specific sources in South Africa can be distinctly identified. This classification scheme has broader implications, as it can be used to analyze and characterize diamonds from other sources, particularly those in the Namaqualand and South West Africa regions. The study also aims to extend its analysis to diamonds from diatreme kimberlite mines in Botswana.

Additionally, the research findings suggest that by classifying diamonds in detail based on their physical attributes, valuable insights can be gained regarding the initial environment in which the diamonds formed and the effects of subsequent geological processes.

For the four mines studied in this work, the diamond classification system provides a framework for future research. One promising avenue for further investigation is the relationship between diamond color, crystal form, and size, particularly in distinguishing between type I and type II diamonds. Additionally, researchers may explore connections between diamond size and color within primary diamond forms, examine co-genetic mineral inclusions, or investigate luminescence, optical anisotropy, and the perfection of the diamond crystal lattice. All of these approaches hold the potential to enhance our understanding of the conditions in which diamonds originated and evolved.
